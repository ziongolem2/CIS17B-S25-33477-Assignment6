Hello, to compile and run this application, you will have to use QT Creator. Once you open the designated file on QT Creator, in the bottom left corner of the QT screen, you will see a Green Player button below the "Debug" Option. After pressing the Green Play Button, the code will run and you will see the GUI at magic.
# IMPORTANT: I've included screenshots above this README file for my working application on QT Creator for every scenario, such as the output when you run the code, the output when you press the "Help Button", etc.
